This script gathers information from the Google Code Issue Tracker. It 
requires that the Google Project Hosting API be downloaded; it can be
found at http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/downloads/list.

Running this script outputs various statistics about the project.
The default project is sympy, but this can be changed by changing 
"sympy" to "your_project" on line 48. The statistics are written to 
stdout; to write to a file one must simply redirect the console
(python main.py > file.txt). An example output file is included.
This script was tested using Python 2.7.2+ in Ubuntu Linux.
