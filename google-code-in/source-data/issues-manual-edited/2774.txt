Edit the doc-string to add list of other function that are closely related to the query.

Ex. 

```
>>> prime?
Docstring:
    Return the nth prime, with the primes indexed as prime(1) = 2,
    prime(2) = 3, etc.... The nth prime is approximately n*log(n) and
    can never be larger than 2**n.
    
    Reference: http://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/BertrandsPostulate.html
```

This is the present doc-string. One needs to add the following line

```
    See also : isprime, primerange, primepi
```
