Unlike other unevaluated operators, Product() is not always unevaluated.  Attempted evaluation should be the job of product().  This is how Sum/summation works:

```py
>>> Product(n, (n, 1, 2))
2
>>> Sum(n, (n, 1, 2))
```

```
  2    
 __    
 \ `   
  )   n
 /_,   
n = 1  
```
```
>>> product(n, (n, 1, 2))
2

>>> summation(n, (n, 1, 2))
3
```
