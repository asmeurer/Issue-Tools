The original logo is found at http://code.google.com/p/sympy/source/browse/#svn%2Fmaterials%2Flogo   The problem is that the transparency is not done correctly on the tail, so that it does not look good unless the background is white.  We need to fix it so that it uses the correct kind of alpha channel, so that it looks good everywhere.  There is a svg image there, though I didn't have much luck with it.
