DeprecationWarning is turned off by default in Python 2.7, so all of our deprecated behavior that we deprecate with DeprecationWarning is not shown to the majority of our users (unless they are specifically looking for it, they won't find it).  This was done because most users of Python programs can't do anything if the program uses deprecated behavior, so they don't care to see the warning.  But I think most developers don't really do a good job of turning the warnings on, unfortunately.

I think we should create a SymPyDeprecationWarning that subclasses from DeprecationWarning, but is turned on by default in isympy.  See <a title="Turn on deprecation warnings in isympy"  href="/p/sympy/issues/detail?id=2142">issue 2142</a>.  That way, users of scripts that use sympy won't be bothered by them, but people who use isympy, who should be bothered by them in my opinion, will be. This will likely also include the developers of most of those scripts.
