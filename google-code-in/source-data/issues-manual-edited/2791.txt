Currently slow tests are simply skipped, but this makes it hard to actually run them. There should be a decorator for this (e.g. @slow) that would all to to run such tests when give an extra option to bin/test or test() (--slow and slow=True, respectively). It should be also possible to specify a timeout for slow tests so that they do not hang test runner. It should be also possible to press Ctrl+C (KeyboardInterrupt) to kill a slow test without killing test runner. There should be statistics added at the end which would tell how many slow tests were run, how many timed out and maybe other.
