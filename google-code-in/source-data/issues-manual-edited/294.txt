I think there should soon be documentation in the code for most, if not
all, of the classes and functions, even if it is only a single line. This
can be useful for both the generated API documentation, and through
interactive help (i.e., the help() command in an interactive Python
session). If there is a need for this, I am fine going through all of the
code and documenting everything, or getting a good start on it.
