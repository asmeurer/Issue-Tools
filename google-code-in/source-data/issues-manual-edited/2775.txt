Edit the doc-string to add list of other function that are closely related to the query.


This is the list of .py files which contains the functions.

```
sympy/combinatorics/generators.py  
sympy/combinatorics/prufer.py
sympy/combinatorics/graycode.py
sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py  
sympy/combinatorics/subsets.py
```

There are around 98(at max) functions which one needs to understand (the input parameters and final result and not the code) to interrelate them.
