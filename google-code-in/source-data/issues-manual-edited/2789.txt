But this is a root of `x**16 - 1`.  I don't know how minpoly works internally if this can be done in a general fashion for exponentials nested inside other expressions (like e.g., `sqrt(1 + exp(I*pi/8)))`.

Marking as Code-In difficulty hard because this is a nontrivial algorithm, especially for a high school student.
