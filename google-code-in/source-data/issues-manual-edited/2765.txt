See https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/Assumptions and some threads on the mailing list, as well as any issue with the Assumptions label.  We have two assumptions systems in SymPy, the old system, which works like 

```
>>> x = Symbol('x', positive=True)
>>> x.is_positive
True
```

and the new system, which works like

```
>>> ask(Q.positive(x), Q.positive(x))
True
```
