The method used by the 1st_exact solver is a nice one to use by hand, but it's kind of flaky.  I didn't realize at the time of writing it that you can actually express the solution using integrals without introducing parameters or dummy integration limits.  This solution is given in Table II of the paper "Symbolic Integration: The Stormy Decade" by Joel Moses.  I was able to download this paper for free from Google Scholar.  If you cannot access it and are interested in fixing this issue, contact me and I will send it to you.
