Integral.transform is confusing, since it requires you to use the same integration variable.  But usually, when we do a transfrom on an integral we change the name of the variable.  It should allow something like

```py
Integral.transform(x, 2*y, y)
```

where y is the new variable.  The third argument would default to the integration variable, so that you can still use the current syntax.

Also, the docstring needs some doctests, which would also make it less confusing.
