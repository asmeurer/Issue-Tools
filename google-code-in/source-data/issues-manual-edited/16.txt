Let's get inspired by ginac. This code should make it easy to compute for
example einstein equations from the (symbolic) metric tensor. We can do it
already now, but it would be nice to type in equations in the index form as
found in the general relativity books and then just plug in a symbolic
matrix for the metric tensor, and it would figure all the rest by itself.
