Some of the Code-In tasks include translating our documentation to different languages. If this happens, we would need a way to manage all of these files (we might have many languages, after all). It's also important to know when and how much are these files out of date (as they eventually will be). Usually, GUI applications use gettext and have tons of .po files lying around, but I'm not sure that's the right approach for us. Marking this as a Code-In Research task.
