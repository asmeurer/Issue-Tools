The issue tracker can provide some valuable statistics about the health of the project - it might be interesting to graph the number of open issues, number of issues per category, the average "age" of the (closed/open) issues, who closes the most issues, the number of issue reports by users (as opposed to developers of SymPy) etc. This likely involves interfacing somehow with the Google API.
