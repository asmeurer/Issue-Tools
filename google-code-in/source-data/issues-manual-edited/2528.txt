I just noticed that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SymPy" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SymPy</a> is a little old with its information.  None of it is wrong, but I think the features list could be updated.  It seems to be roughly the same as the features listed at sympy.org and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sympy/" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/sympy/</a>, so perhaps those should be updated too.

Also, SymPy's stuff at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_computer_algebra_systems" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_computer_algebra_systems</a> should be updated.  I did notice some of that is wrong.
