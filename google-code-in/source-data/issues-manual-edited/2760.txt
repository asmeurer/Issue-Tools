```py
latex(x**2, symbol_names={x:'x_i'})
```


works fine, but when you try something as

```py
latex(~x, symbol_names={x:'x_i'})
```

it doesn't. Besides, every time you need latex to use x's symbol_name, you need to pass the symbol_names dictionary.

Sage has some nice functionality:

```py
var('sui', latex_name="s_{u,i}")
```

and you don't have to use a special dictionary everytime you need to typeset the symbol.
